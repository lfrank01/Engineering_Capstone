# Engineering Capstone Bow Adapter and Prosthetic Hand 
### Angus and Luke Frank
This README is the week-by-week documentation of our senior-year capstone project. Our goal is to create a violin bow adapter and prosthetic hand for two customers within the CHS community. 
 
# Week of September 17th:
### What did you work on?
* This week, we truly began the process of our project. We finalized our capstone plan, to build a violin bow adapter and prosthetic hand, and had meetings with our two customers, Ramisi and Alex, to make preparations. Following our meetings, we presented to the rest of the capstone class. 

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Creating and finalizing the slideshow
* Conducting customer meetings
* Communicating with Elisabeth Scharf for her bow adapter design
* Talking with Ms. Waters about the proper grip technique of a violin bow

### What decisions were made?
* We narrowed our project down to the violin bow project (Ramisi) and prosthetic hand (Alex). We had to dismiss the Elena project, entailing the optimization of a personalized clutch grip, for the sake of time. Hopefully, another group will take this on. 
* We presented our slideshow

### What new resources did you find?
* Ms. Waters gifted us a used violin bow to demonstrate/practice the correct technique. 
* We discovered that the MyoWare muscle sensor could function as the processing unit for muscle signals in the prosthetic hand.

### What new issues were discovered?
* A violin bow requires many aspects of the hand for optimal performance. To create a more comfortable design for Ramisi, a pronation and supination mechanism would be ideal and have to be designed. 

### What went well?
* Both customers were communicative and excited during our meetings. We successfully opened up lines of communication (text and email) with our clients and established relations
* The slideshow presentation was successful and effective

### What was difficult?
* What to do with time. We need to reach out to possible collaborators and obtain our resources

### What is your plan for next week?
* Establish documentation (GitHub repo)--this first week is being written in retrospect
* Obtain model/design ideas for the Ramisi bow adapter

 
# Week of September 26th:

### What did you work on?
* Communicating with Elisabeth Scharf to obtain the thermoplastics she used for her designs
* Making a Github for our projects
* Understanding the mechanics of violin-playing 

### What decisions were made?
* To build off and improve upon Elisabeth’s previous work. We hope to use her thermoplastics from the previous year
* That we would like to collaborate with either Dr. King (an expert in prosthetics) and other possible PTs and UVA connections

### What new resources did you find?
* That Elisabeth has a model of her second-to-final design and resources for the bow adapter that we can use

### What new issues were discovered?
* Not a specifically new issue, but we’ve realized that we must work as fast as possible so that our clients can have the resources they need as soon as they can. There is no fixed deadline for the capstones, just that the designs work and are available as soon as possible. 

### What went well?
* We’ve made good progress by learning what the needs of our clients are and what they need to have, and what would be nice for Alex and  Ramisi. 
* We have successfully kept the line of communication open with Elisabeth. 

### What was difficult?
* This week was a short week, and Angus was out for the block day, so we had very little time to get work done. 

### What is your plan for next week?
* For next week, we plan on getting the materials from Elisabeth Scharf and getting in touch with a physical therapist that Elisabeth Scharf worked with. We would like to start making actual physical progress on the development of our projects. 


# Week of October 3rd:

### What did you work on?
* Practicing the mechanics of bow movement with the violin
* Testing the properties of the thermoplastics graciously given to us by Elisabeth Scharf
* Visiting Ramisi's previous bow adapter design and attempting to reverse engineer and identify design flaws

https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/DesignReflection.jpg
### What decisions were made?
* We decided that using a hate plate to create a bath for the thermoplastics to heat up in was the best course of action for maximum material consitency and adaptability
* We had already been pretty sure that we wanted to use thermoplastics, but after working with some material, we confirmed that it was the best course of action

### What new resources did you find?
* Elle Polifka is a great resource for learning how the mechanics of violin work. Elle taught Luke the basic form of violin 
* [E-NABLE Prosthetics Design](https://enablingthefuture.org) as a great resource for model prosthetic hands. They have a DIY prosthetic creation page that looks very helpful

### What new issues were discovered?
* We do not yet know the specific material of thermoplastic that Elisabeth gave us. Thus, we had to experiment with a heat gun to try to find the right temperature for molding at; we found a rough estimate (~460 degrees Fahrenheit)
* Using a heat gun isn't very good at applying heat uniformly. We discovered that we will likely need a heat plate and tray of water. The Sigma Lab has a heat plate, and we're looking into if the chemistry department has trays we can use
* Applying the thermoplastic to the skin when molding. If done correctly, we do not believe it will burn, but we will obviously have to experiment with the best way of applying the thermoplastics 

### What went well?
* We successfully managed to mold thermoplastic material using the heat gun and mold it
* Luke learned the basics of violin and was able to explain it
* We were productive and learned a lot more about how the previous design worked by reverse-engineering

### What was difficult?
* Having to ask Elisabeth Scharf about certain things, like what material of thermoplastic we have and how she applied heat to the thermoplastics (like a furnace or heat gun) requires a bit of patience because of the space-time gap between us. We sometimes have to divert our focus for a bit while waiting on a key bit of insight

### What is your plan for next week?
* We hope to take Ramisi's hand measurements
* Using the heat plate and tray of water (first must be found) to apply heat uniformly
* Improving our thermoplastic molding skills and learning how to cut the thermoplastic for a cleaner design (the final product should look aesthetic


# Week of October 10th:

### What did you work on?
* Exploring alternatives for heating up the thermoplastics. The previous week, we used a heat gun. We realized that using water with a cookie tray and heat plate would diffuse heat more evenly across the thermoplastic
* Understanding how the bow mold was attached to the hand attachment
* Gaining experience with thermoplastic molding through trial and error. Also, learning how to handle the hot thermoplastics safely
* Drawing models of the hand prosthesis design and also creating a labeled diagram of a violin to understand its mechanics

### What decisions were made?
* To experiment with alternate heating methods--using a heat plate and water instead of the heat gun (which doesn't spread energy evenly)
* To try to make a mold of Luke's hand for the experience
* To use our own cookie tray (Angus's) since we couldn't get one from the cafeteria 

### What new resources did you find?
* A cookie tray (Angus's), a heat plate (Sigma Lab's), and a heat measuring device (thermometer from the Biology classroom)

<img src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Angus_Heat_Plate.jpg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Angus_Heat_Plate.jpg" width="300" height="400" />

### What new issues were discovered?
* A very key problem with using a heat plate with water is that it takes around 10-20 minutes to heat up to a close to insufficient temperature. We got the heat plate to heat the water up to ~60 degrees F, but this temperature needed to be more to harness the thermoplastics' molding capabilities.
* Molding can be challenging. There's a short time until cooling, meaning the molding process has to happen quickly.
* There are pressure points we must be mindful of, like the ulnar styloid on the wrist. The design has to be shaped or sometimes cut to avoid rubbing on these possible pressure points like the ulnar styloid, which requires a good molding job (which we will get better at with experience)

### What went well?
* We made use of the time we had and got to try out the heat plate method, determining that water was likely our best bet for making the thermoplastic moldable, although probably not with a heat plate


<img src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Notes_1.jpg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Notes_1.jpg" width="300" height="500" /><img src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Note_2.jpg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Note_2.jpg" width="300" height="500" />

### What was difficult?
* The heat plate took a long time to reach 60 degrees F (which we discovered was not enough energy), meaning we had less time to mold and had to draw designs and brainstorm while waiting around
* Luke was away in Boston on Friday, and on Thursday, Angus wasn't there because it was a weirdly-scheduled PSAT day. Thus, we had less time to work
* The heat plate was much smaller than the cookie tray, so it was easy for the cookie tray to tip over if given a small touch by accident, and the heat had to take more time to diffuse from the center of the cookie tray to the outer parts

### What is your plan for next week?
* Elisabeth Scharf will be in town next week, and we're planning to work with her for a class period so that she can teach us the skills she learned last year
* We plan to continue practicing our molding and talk to Ramisi about the pressure points she had on the previous mold she used so that we can better our designing


# Week of October 17th:

### What did you work on?
* We continued improving our thermoplastic molding abilities 
* We debated methods of attaching the prosthesis. Our ideas were as follows:
 * Bending the thermoplastic around the hand (closing the mold) for more of a friction fit
 * Using a bandage-like material to connect the two sides (closing a gap between the two ends)
 * Using velcro straps on each side to connect the two sides
* We thought about how to attach the violin bow to the prosthesis (friction fit or an adhesive idea)

### What decisions were made?
* We asked Elisabeth Scharf, who was in town on college break if she could teach us her skills on Monday
* We decided to use a tea kettle instead of a heat plate to get the water hot enough to mold the thermoplastic (before it wasn't hot enough)
* We used Elle Polifka for making a hand mold. Ramisi was not there on Monday, and thus we had to improvise

### What new resources did you find?
* The biggest discovery was that a tea kettle works much better than a heat plate
* The kettle reaches hotter temperatures (we needed around boiling point as opposed to 60 degrees F) and takes less time to heat up
* Velcro straps were not necessarily new resources, but we realized this week that they'd be a good fit for our design

### What new issues were discovered?
* The water that the thermoplastic is prepared in has to be extremely hot, at around boiling point (212 F). Otherwise, the thermoplastic will not truly be moldable. We were amazed at how malleable the thermoplastic was when it was heated with boiling water. However, the hot temperature needed for the water means that we have limited time to do molding since the water cools down. We had to reprepare the water several times to get it back to a hot enough temperature
* The thermoplastic molding, once hardened, can have many points of pressure when it pushes against the thumb, for example, or wrist. The molding has to be done skillfully to prevent sharp corners. Sand-paper may be needed

### What went well?
* We successfully made a rough mold for Elle Pollifka's hand that also had a space where the violin bow could be anchored. However, we forgot to take into account how the bowstring hair would press against the thermoplastic and thus had to rethink our initial mold

### What was difficult?
* Doing the molding in enough time. The water for the thermoplastic was usually not hot enough
* Submerging an already formed mold for the redesign. We put the hot water in the cookie tray to heat the flat thermoplastic material, but it takes more work to submerge a more complex shape in a flat container. We may need to use a beaker
* There were times when we had to cut the thermoplastic to save material or adapt the design, but the hardened thermoplastic material is quite hard to cut

### What is your plan for next week?
* Create a working model for Ramisi to try out, which would mean that we'd ask her if we could try doing a mold of her hand
* Identifying mold pressure points and fixing these areas with either sandpaper or making smooth cuts 
* Communicating with Alex about our plans for the prosthetic hand. Working on one project at a time will be the best way to have successful results, but this means that Alex's project will come later in the year. We want to communicate this to her to be clear about our schedule and constraints

# Week of October 24th:

### What did you work on?
* This week, we were able to have Elisabeth Scharf come in and show us the best ways to mold thermoplastics. 
* We created a mold with a friend's hand. 
* We created an extremely rough mold for Ramisi.
* We emailed Alex about our plans and schedule but haven't received a response yet.

### What decisions were made?
* We've decided we need a much deeper pot or pan to heat up since the thermoplastic needs to be fully submerged in the water. 
* We should be getting closer to a final mold in the next few weeks or month. 

### What new resources did you find?
* A deeper pot or pan is most useful to be able to fully submerge the thermoplastic.
* We used Mr. Miller's sharp scissors to cut the thermoplastics, which is most likely the best thing we have to cut the thermoplastic.

### What new issues were discovered? 
* We don't have the same lunch as Ramisi, so on non-block days, we have very little time to do any testing. 

### What went well?
* We were able to get our first model for Ramisi, which is super exciting and a great strive towards the final. 

### What was difficult?
* We only had two days for the week, but we were extremely productive, and it makes us think about how much more we could've gotten done if we had a full week to work. 

### What is your plan for next week?
* Create a much better model for Ramisi, with much more definition than the last.


# Week of October 31st:
 
### What did you work on? 
* This week, we worked on molding for the violin bow adapter.

### What decisions were made?
* We decided that we'll make a temporary bow adapter for Ramisi's so she can play by next week. 
* We'll try to have the final mold with in a month. 

### What went well?
* We made great strides in having something for Ramisi to play with and learned a lot about what works for her and what hurts. 
* Able to mold the model around Ramisi's bow. 

### What was difficult?
* While molding, it takes a while between each molding, so we only have around two or three times a class to remold.  

### What is your plan for next week?
* Do more molding with Ramisi
* Contact UVA Hand Specialist Ms. Hite for advice on how to improve our molding

# Week of November 7th:

### What did you work on?
* We reached out to Dr. Stacy Hite from UVA via email, asking if we could talk and have some of her advice on how to have a clean finish
* We met with Ramisi and Elle to discuss the current mold and how to improve it. It's currently too tight

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Emailing Ms. Hite and checking with Ramisi that she was O.K. with us reaching out to her
* Meeting with Elle and Ramisi to plan for the next week

### What decisions were made?
* To reach out to Ms. Hite
* That we should bring a cup next week to make molding in 3D easier

### What new resources did you find?
* No new resources necessarily, but we did decide that we wanted to talk to Ms. Hite
* Another resource that we've already been aware of, but Adrian Anantawan's violin adapter might be a design worth considering

### What new issues were discovered?
* We already knew from the previous week that Ramisi's current mold was too tight, but we also learned that we need to change the orientation of the mold to enable more horizontal movement

### What went well?
* We successfully emailed Ms. Hite and organized times to meet with Ramisi

### What was difficult?
* We didn't do any molding this week and were, in general, not extremely productive (emailing Ms. Hite was the main point of action)
* There were only 3 days of school and two days of engineering class, so there was not a lot of time to work with

### What is your plan for next week?
* Communicating with Ms. Hite about how to make our final design
* Making a comfortable mold for Ramisi
* Experimenting with the idea of an Anantawan-inspired design


# Week of November 14th:
### What did you work on?
* We followed up on Dr. Hite's response by sending her a PDF of what we have done so far and asking for her thoughts on different design options
* We did molding with Ramisi on Friday using a cup as a container for the boiling water, as opposed to a flat cookie tray.

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Making the PDF for Dr. Hite
* Setting up times to meet with Ramisi 
* Doing molding with the cup instead of the cookie tray

### What decisions were made?
* We've decided to change our current design. Having the hand orientation be vertical, as opposed to horizontal (the natural way), is uncomfortable and ineffective. We should have thought more about this when making our design
* To use a cup instead of a cookie tray. The cup makes it much easier to cover all surface area of the mold
* To look into using a 3D printed / thermoplastic hybrid design

### What new resources did you find?
* The cup for pouring the boiling water into

### What new issues were discovered?
* That our current design idea is not adequate and has to be changed
* We have been using the same thermoplastic sheet for our molding, but with many consecutive attempts, the plastic becomes stuck to itself and hard to make back into a flat sheet for redesign

### What went well?
* We got the cup for molding and emailed Dr. Hite

### What was difficult?
* It's quite frustrating the pace the project is going. Obviously, our client directly benefits from us making a successful design, so it feels like a disservice to not be doing the best we can. 
* We may try Elisabeth's design (horizontal design), Anantawan's design (the spatula), or a thermoplastic-3D-printed hybrid. We don't know which is best, and it's hard not having clarity.

### What is your plan for next week?
* Rethink, redesign, remold
* Hopefully, communicate with Dr. Hite
* Develop a new design that works well


# Week of November 28th:

### What did you work on?
* We were very productive this week, which was a good contrast to the difficulty we had with redesigning last week. It also helped that we had thanksgiving break as a week off. 
* We worked on remodeling Ramisi's design / sketching possible ideas
* We developed a model from cheap materials of what we wanted the design to look like, and it was functional
* We also asked Mr. Miller to reassure Alex that we haven't forgotten about them

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Sketching out ideas
* Designing a prototype of the idea we liked and was functional

### What decisions were made?
* We scratched our previous design and went back to the drawing board
* We did brainstorming on both a Google Doc and a piece of paper
* We debated reaching out to Dr. Hite in case she was simply busy, but because she has not responded, we will likely send a second follow-up over the weekend or next week
* We also updated Elisabeth on the project and our current model to see her thoughts (she hasn't responded yet, though)

### What new resources did you find?
* PLM Flex 3D printing
* Basic constructing supplies for rudimentary prototyping (tape, adhesive wrap, styrofoam (with a laser cutter), and clay
* Nuts and bolts as fastening mechanisms. Also, a 3D-printed clamp design

### What new issues were discovered?
* The tea kettle we were heating up our water with broke after Luke dropped it while taking it home after the break, and his dad threw it out because the top was cracked. In turn, we have to look for a new tea kettle, and because we didn't have one this week, we couldn't use thermoplastics and so we used basic supplies
* Not necessarily new, but the delay in communication between Dr. Hite and us remains a challenge

### What went well?
* A lot went well -- we used all the time we had, didn't wait around, and successfully prototyped
* Luke was out of class Friday, but Angus still was productive and finished the working prototype
* We effectively followed a design process by finding out what we had to change, how to do it, and then doing it.

### What was difficult?
* We didn't have Dr. Hite's input on our work because she hasn't responded in the past week or so
* We didn't have thermoplastics
* We didn't have a tea kettle

### What is your plan for next week?
* To create our model out of refined materials (thermoplastics, wood if necessary, adhesive wrap/velcro, etc.)
* Work with Ramisi to experiment with the new design
* Hopefully, get in touch with Dr. Hite

### Below are some pictures of our current design prototype (using basic materials)

# Week of December 5th - Experimenting with the New Design:

### What did you work on?
* Working on the new model with basic materials 
* Revising the model after testing it with Ramisi
* Contacting Form5 for a meeting time

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* We contacted Mr. Westbrook of [Form5](https://www.form5prostheticsinc.org/) for a meeting time (scheduled for **Dec 12, 11:00 AM Eastern!**)
* We polished up the GitHub for it to be informative to Form5 
* We met with Ramisi on Thursday to test our prototype

### What decisions were made?
* To meet with Form5. We're really grateful for Mr. Miller for connecting us to them
* To buy a new tea kettle on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09H3LWKYQ/ref=cm_sw_r_api_i_SK4FYTD02EZ2P3VSYN1T_0?_encoding=UTF8&pldnSite=1&scrlybrkr=af1ed8a6&th=1)
* To rework our design after meeting with Ramisi (we like the idea but it needs adjustments)

### What new resources did you find?
* Form5 as a source of expertise that we can learn from

### What new issues were discovered?
* We didn't have a tea kettle and so had to buy one. However, the monthly order CHS allows for project purchases had passsed (an inefficient system), so we had to buy it using our own funds
* Our prototype was too tight on the wrist for Ramisi and to loose on the thumb anchor, but we expected that we'd have to make changes

### What went well?
* We contacted Form5 and documented our project with pictures well
* We organized with Ramisi well, adjusting when she wasn't available / had another committment
* We prepared our prototype in good time and were ready/productive in starting changes. 

### What was difficult?
* Not having a tea kettle
* Only being able to meet with Ramisi on Thursday. We had to make use of documenting and messaging Form5 in the meantime

### What is your plan for next week?
* Discuss solutions with Form5
* Have a reworked prototype that fits Ramisi comfortably
* Have the tea kettle and use it for better materials if it makes a difference

### Below are pictures from modeling with Ramisi - the wrist and thumb anchors need adjusting

# Week of December 12th

### What did you work on?
* We were able to meet with Aaron Westbrook from Form5 and got great feed back from him about our new design. 
* We started the procces of making a 3d bow holder. 
* New tea kettle came in, extremley grateful for Lukes parents buying that for us!

### What Decisons were made? 
* In the new year we will hop right back on focus to finish the bow adapter as soon as possible so our client can enjoy the beautiful art of the violon. 
* We will continue to work with Aaron and Form5 to enhance our design and they will give amazing feed back! 

### What new resources did you find?
* Thanks to Mr.Miller we have made a great connection with Form5 and will continue to have their help and input. 

### What new issues were discovered? 
* We are running behind and taking a little longer than we would like to finish this project.
* We won't be able to work on the adapter for two weeks due to winter break, which sucks. 

### What went well?
* We had a great zoom meeting with Aaron from Form5, he gave us great feedback.
* Form5 worked on a project like this a couple years ago and said they'll try and find some pictures from that design. 

### What is our plan for the new year(2023)?
* We want to wrap up the final design soon after we come back from winter break.

# Week of January 3rd

### What did you work on?
* Creating a model that takes a lot from Form5's design. 
* Working in Onshape to create a box to hold the violin bow. 

### What Decisons were made?
* We will be combining previous designs of ours and Form5's design for the final model. 

### What new resources did you find?
* We were able to find a video of Form5's product in use, which was great to see so we could find new ideas. 

### What issues were discovered?
* Form5 at the momment are moving so they won't be able to send us the pictures from the model till a later date. 

### What went well?
* We've been making a ton of prototypes and we feel extremly confident in the direction were heading for the final model. 

### What is our plan for next week? 
* We will continue to work on the model and make little tweeks as we go. 

### These are images of Form5's design.

# Week of January 9th

### What did you work on this week?
* This week we spent all of our time prototyping, made lots of littile tweeks and adjusments. 
* Met with Ramisi to see how she feels about the design. 

### What decisons were made? 
* We have decided to put the bow below the hand instead of on top.
* We will email Aaron next week on Monday to touch base and see if we can get the documents from him. 

### What issues were discovered? 
* Aaron is extremly busy sohe has not been able to send the documents from his project. 

### What went well?
* We really like our new design and think thats a great direction to headed in.
* Ramisi really liked what we were doing and felt comfortable on her. 

### What is our plan for next week?
* We will be working on a presentaion to present to our peers as were half way through the school year. 
* Continue enhancing our models. 

# New Design!
