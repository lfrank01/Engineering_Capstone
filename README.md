# Engineering Capstone Bow Adapter and Prosthetic Hand 
### Angus and Luke Frank
This README is the week-by-week documentation of our senior-year capstone project. Our goal is to create a violin bow adapter and prosthetic hand for two customers within in the CHS community. 
 
# Week of September 17th:
### What did you work on?
* This week we truly began the process of our project. We finalized our capstone plan, to build a violin bow adapter and prosthetic hand, and had meetings with our two customers, Ramisi and Alex, to make preparations. Following our meetings, we made a presentation to the rest of the capstone class. 

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Creating and finalizing the slideshow
* Conducting customer meetings
* Communicating with Elisabeth Scharf for her bow adapter design
* Talking with Ms. Waters about the proper grip technique of a violin bow

### What decisions were made?
* We narrowed our project down to the violin bow project (Ramisi) and prosthetic hand (Alex). We had to dismiss the Elena project, entailing the optimization of a personalized clutch grip, for the sake of time. Hopefully another group will take this on. 
* We presented our slideshow

### What new resources did you find?
* Ms. Waters gifted us a used violin bow to demonstrate/practice the correct technique. 
* We discovered that the MyoWare muscle sensor could function as the processing unit for muscle signals in the prosthetic hand.

### What new issues were discovered?
* A violin bow requires many aspects of the hand for optimal performance. To create a more comfortable design for Ramisi, a pronation and suppination mechanism would be ideal and have to be designed. 

### What went well?
* Both customers were communicative and excited during our meetings. We successfully opened up lines of communication (text and email) with our clients and established relations
* The slideshow presentation was succesful and effective

### What was difficult?
* What to do with time. We need to reach out to possible collaborators and obtain our resources

### What is your plan for next week?
* Establish documentation (GitHub repo)--this first week is being written in retrospect
* Obtain model / design ideas for the Ramisi bow adapter

 
# Week of September 26th:

### What did you work on?
* Communicating with Elisabeth Scharf to obtain the thermoplastics she used for her designs
* Making a Github for our projects
* Undertanding the mechanics of violin-playing 

### What decisions were made?
* To build off and improve upon Elisabeth’s previous work. We hope to use her thermoplastics from the previous year
* That we would like to collaborate with either Dr. King (an expert in prosthetics) and other possible PTs and UVA connections
* What new resources did you find?
* That Elisabeth has a model of her second-to-final design and resources for the bow adapter that we can use

### What new issues were discovered?
* Not a specifically new issue, but we’ve realized that we must work as fast as possible so that our clients can have the resources they need as soon they can. There is no fixed deadline they need the capstones by, just that the designs work and are available as soon as possible. 

### What went well?
* We’ve made good progress by learning what the needs of our clients are and what the need to have and what would be nice for Alex and  Remisce. 
* We have been successful in keeping the line of communication open with Elisabeth. 

### What was difficult?
* This week was a short week and Angus was out for the block day, so we had very little time to get work done. 

### What is your plan for next week?
* For next week we plan on getting the materials from Elisabeth Scharf and getting in touch with a physical therapist that Elisabeth Scharf worked with. We would like to start making actual, physical progress on the development of our projects.
