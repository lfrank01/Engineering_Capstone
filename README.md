# Engineering Capstone Bow Adapter and Prosthetic Hand 
### Angus and Luke Frank
This README is the week-by-week documentation of our senior-year capstone project. Our goal is to create a violin bow adapter and prosthetic hand for two customers within in the CHS community. 
 
# Week of September 17th:
### What did you work on?
* This week we truly began the process of our project. We finalized our capstone plan, to build a violin bow adapter and prosthetic hand, and had meetings with our two customers, Ramisi and Alex, to make preparations. Following our meetings, we made a presentation to the rest of the capstone class. 

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Creating and finalizing the slideshow
* Conducting customer meetings
* Communicating with Elisabeth Scharf for her bow adapter design
* Talking with Ms. Waters about the proper grip technique of a violin bow

### What decisions were made?
* We narrowed our project down to the violin bow project (Ramisi) and prosthetic hand (Alex). We had to dismiss the Elena project, entailing the optimization of a personalized clutch grip, for the sake of time. Hopefully another group will take this on. 
* We presented our slideshow

### What new resources did you find?
* Ms. Waters gifted us a used violin bow to demonstrate/practice the correct technique. 
* We discovered that the MyoWare muscle sensor could function as the processing unit for muscle signals in the prosthetic hand.

### What new issues were discovered?
* A violin bow requires many aspects of the hand for optimal performance. To create a more comfortable design for Ramisi, a pronation and suppination mechanism would be ideal and have to be designed. 

### What went well?
* Both customers were communicative and excited during our meetings. We successfully opened up lines of communication (text and email) with our clients and established relations
* The slideshow presentation was succesful and effective

### What was difficult?
* What to do with time. We need to reach out to possible collaborators and obtain our resources

### What is your plan for next week?
* Establish documentation (GitHub repo)--this first week is being written in retrospect
* Obtain model / design ideas for the Ramisi bow adapter

 
# Week of September 26th:

### What did you work on?
* Communicating with Elisabeth Scharf to obtain the thermoplastics she used for her designs
* Making a Github for our projects
* Undertanding the mechanics of violin-playing 

### What decisions were made?
* To build off and improve upon Elisabeth’s previous work. We hope to use her thermoplastics from the previous year
* That we would like to collaborate with either Dr. King (an expert in prosthetics) and other possible PTs and UVA connections

### What new resources did you find?
* That Elisabeth has a model of her second-to-final design and resources for the bow adapter that we can use

### What new issues were discovered?
* Not a specifically new issue, but we’ve realized that we must work as fast as possible so that our clients can have the resources they need as soon they can. There is no fixed deadline they need the capstones by, just that the designs work and are available as soon as possible. 

### What went well?
* We’ve made good progress by learning what the needs of our clients are and what the need to have and what would be nice for Alex and  Remisce. 
* We have been successful in keeping the line of communication open with Elisabeth. 

### What was difficult?
* This week was a short week and Angus was out for the block day, so we had very little time to get work done. 

### What is your plan for next week?
* For next week we plan on getting the materials from Elisabeth Scharf and getting in touch with a physical therapist that Elisabeth Scharf worked with. We would like to start making actual, physical progress on the development of our projects. 


# Week of October 3rd:

### What did you work on?
* Practing the mechanics of bow movement with the violin
* Testing the properties of the thermoplastics graciously given to us by Elisabeth Scharf
* Visiting Ramisi's previous bow adapter design and attempting to reverse engineer and identify design flaws

https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/DesignReflection.jpg
### What decisions were made?
* We decided that using a hate plate to create a bath for the thermoplastics to heat up in was the best course of action for maximum material consitency and adaptability
* We had already been pretty sure that we wanted to use thermoplastics, but after working with some material, we confirmed that it was the best course of action

### What new resources did you find?
* Elle Polifka as a great reasource for learning how the mechanics of violin work. Elle taught Luke the basic form for violin 
* [E-NABLE Prosthetics Design](https://enablingthefuture.org) as a great reasource for model prosthetic hands. They have a DIY prosthetic creation page that looks very helpful

### What new issues were discovered?
* We do not know yet the specific material of thermoplastic that Elisabeth gave us. Thus, we had to experiment with a heat gun to try find the right temperature for molding at; we found a rough estimate (~460 degrees Fahrenheit)
* Using a heat gun isn't very good at applying heat uniformly. We discovered that we will likely need a heat plate and tray of water. The Sigma Lab has a heat plate, and we're looking into if the chemistry department has trays we can use
* Applying the thermoplastic to skin when molding. If done correctly, we do not believe it will burn, but we will obviously have to experiment with the best way of applying the thermoplastics 

### What went well?
* We succesfully managed to mold thermoplastic material using the heat gun and mold it
* Luke learned the basics of violin and was able to explain it
* We were productive and learned a lot more about how the previous design worked by reverse-engineering

### What was difficult?
* Having to ask Elisabeth Scharf about certain things like what material of thermoplastic we have and how she applied heat to the thermoplastics (like a furnance or heat gun) requires a bit of patience because of the space-time gap between us. We sometimes have to divert our focus for a bit while waiting on a key bit of insight

### What is your plan for next week?
* We hope to take Ramisi's hand measurements
* Using the heat plate and tray of water (first must be found) to apply heat uniformly
* Improving our thermoplastic molding skills and learning how to cut the thermoplastic for a cleaner design (the final product should look aesthetic


# Week of October 10th:

### What did you work on?
* Exploring alternatives for heating up the thermoplastics. The previous week, we used a heat gun. We realized that using water with a cookie tray and heat plate would diffuse heat more evenly across the thermoplastic
* Understanding how the bow mold was attatched to the hand attatchement
* Gaining experience with thermoplastic molding through trial and error. Also learning how to handle the hot thermoplastics safely
* Drawing models of the hand prosthesis design and also creating a labeled diagram of a violin to understand its mechanics

### What decisions were made?
* To experiment with alternate heating methods--using a heat plate and water instead of the heat gun (which doesn't spread energy evenly)
* To try make a mold of Luke's hand for experience
* To use our own cookie tray (Angus's) since we couldn't get one from the cafeteria 

### What new resources did you find?
* A cookie tray (Angus's), a heat plate (Sigma Lab's), and a heat measuring device (thermometer from the Biology clasroom)

<img src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Angus_Heat_Plate.jpg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Angus_Heat_Plate.jpg" width="300" height="400" />

### What new issues were discovered?
* A very key problem with using a heat plate with water is that it takes around 10-20 minutes to heat up to a close to insufficient temperature. We got the heat plate to heat the water up to ~60 degrees F, but this temperature was not nearly enough to harness the thermoplastics's molding capabilites.
* Molding isn't easy. There's a short time until cooling, which means that the molding process has to happen quickly.
* There are pressure points that we have to be mindful of like ulnar styloid on the wrist. The design has to be shaped or sometimes cut to avoid rubbing on these possible pressure points like the ulnar styloid, which requires a good molding job (which we will get better at with experience)

### What went well?
* We made use of the time we had and got to try out the heat plate method, determining that water was likely our best bet for making the thermoplastic moldable, although probably not with a heatplat


<img src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Notes_1.jpg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Notes_1.jpg" width="300" height="500" /><img src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Note_2.jpg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/lfrank01/Engineering_Capstone/blob/main/media/Adapter_Note_2.jpg" width="300" height="500" />

### What was difficult?
* The heat plate took a long time to reach 60 degrees F (which we discovered was not enough energy), meaning we had less time to mold and had to draw designs and brainstorm while waiting around
* Luke was away at Boston for Friday, and on Thursday, Angus wasn't there because it was a weirdly-scheduled PSAT day. Thus, we had less time to work
* The heat plate was much smaller than the cookie tray, so it was easy for the cookie tray to tip over if given a small touch by accident, and the heat had to take more time to diffuse from the center of the cookie tray to the outer parts

### What is your plan for next week?
* Elisabeth Scharf will be in town next week, and we're planning to work with her for a class period so that she can teach us the skills she learned from last year
* We plan to continue practicing our molding and talk to Ramisi about the pressure points she had on the previous mold she used so that we can better our designing


# Week of October 17th:

### What did you work on?
* We continued improving our thermoplastic molding abilities 
* We debated methods of attatching the prosthesis. Our ideas were as follows:
 * Bending the thermoplastic around the hand (closing the mold) for more of a friction fit
 * Using a bandage-like material to connect the two sides (closing a gap between the two ends)
 * Using velcrow straps on each side to connect the two sides
* We thought about how to attach the violin bow to the prosthesis (friction fit or an adhesive idea)

### What decisions were made?
* We asked Elisabeth Scharf, who was in town on college break, if she could teach us her skills on Monday
* We decided to use a tea kettle instead of a heat plate to get the water hot enough to mold the thermoplastic (before it wasn't hot enough)
* We used Elle Polifka for making a hand mold. Ramisi was not there on Monday and thus we had to improvise

### What new resources did you find?
* The biggest discovery was that a tea kettle works much better than a heat plate
* The kettle reaches hotter temperatures (we needed around boiling point as opposed to 60 degrees F) and takes less time to heat up
* Valcro straps were not neccesarily new reasources, but we realized this week that they'd be a good fit for our design

### What new issues were discovered?
* The water that the thermoplastic is prepared in has to be extremely hot, at around boiling point (212 F). Otherwise, the thermoplastic will not truly be moldable. We were amazed at how maleable the thermoplastic was when it was heated with boiling water. However, the hot temperature needed for the water means that we have limited time to do molding since the water cools down. We had to reprepare the water several times to get it back to a hot enough temperature
* The thermoplastic molding, once hardened, can have many points of pressure when it pushes against the thumb, for example, or wrist. The molding has to be done skillfully to prevent sharp corners. Sand-paper may be needed

### What went well?
* We succesfully made a rough mold for Elle Pollifka's hand that also had a space where the violin bow could be anchored. However, we forgot to take into account how the bow string hair would press against the thermoplastic and thus have to rethink our initial mold

### What was difficult?
* Doing the molding in enough time. The water for the thermoplastic was usually not hot enough
* Submerging an already formed mold for redesign. We put the hot water in the cookie tray for heating the flat thermoplastic material, but it's harder to submerge a more complex shape in a flat container. We may need to use a beaker
* There were times when we had to cut the thermoplastic to save material or adapt the design, but the hardened thermoplastic material is quite hard to cut

### What is your plan for next week?
* Create a working model for Ramisi to try out, which would mean that we'd ask her if we could try doing a mold of her hand
* Identifying mold pressure points and fixing these areas with either sand paper or making smooth cuts 
* Communicating with Alex about our plans for the prosthetic hand. Working on one project at a time will be the best way to have succesful results, but this means that Alex's project will come later in the year. We want to communicate this to her to be clear of our schedule and constraints

# Week of October 24th:

### What did you work on?
* This week we were able to have Elisabeth Scharf come in and show us the best ways to mold thermoplastics. 
* We created a mold with a friends hand. 
* We created a extremly rough mold for Ramisi.
* We emailed Alex about our plans and schedule but haven't gotten a response back yet.

### What decisions were made?
* We've decided we need a much deeper pot or pan to heat up since the thermoplastic needs to be fully submerged in the water. 
* We should be getting closer to a final mold in the next few weeks or month. 

### What new resources did you find?
* A deeper pot or pan is most useful to be able to fully submerge the thermoplastic.
* We used Mr.Millers extremly sharp scissors to cut the thermplastics, which is most likley the best thing we have to cut the thermoplastic.

### What new issues were discovered? 
* We don't have the same lunch as Ramisi so on non-block days we have very little time to do any testing. 

### What went well?
* We were able to get are first model for Ramisi, wh8ich is super exciting and a great strive towards the final. 

### What was difficult?
* We only had two days for the week but we were extremly productive and makes us think about how much more we could've gotten done if we had a full week to work. 

### What is your plan for next week?
* Create a much better model for Ramisi, with much more definition then the last.


# Week of October 31st:
 
### What did you work on? 
* This week we worked on molding for the violin bow adapter.

### What decisions were made?
* We decided the we'll make a temporary bow adapter for Ramisi's so she's able to play by next week. 
* We'll try to have the final mold with in a month. 

### What went well?
* We made great strides to having something for Ramisi's to play with and learned a lot about what works for her and what hurts. 
* Able to mold the model around Ramisi's bow. 

### What was difficult?
* While molding it takes a while between each molding so we only have around two or three times a class to remold.  

### What is your plan for next week?
* Do more molding with Ramisi
* Contact UVA Hand Specialist Ms. Hite for advice on how to improve our molding

# Week of November 7th:

### What did you work on?
* We reached out to Dr. Stacy Hite from UVA via email, asking if we could talk and have some of her advice on how to have a clean finish
* We met with Ramisi and Elle to talk about the current mold and how to improve it. It's currently too tight

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Emailing Ms. Hite and checking with Ramisi that she was O.K. with us reaching out to her
* Meeting with Elle and Ramisi to plan for the next week

### What decisions were made?
* To reach out to Ms. Hite
* That we should bring a cup next week to make molding in 3D easier

### What new resources did you find?
* No new reasources neccessarily, but we did decide that we wanted to talk to Ms. Hite
* Another reasource that we've already been aware of, but Adrian Anantawan's violin adapter might be a design worth considering

### What new issues were discovered?
* We already new from the previous week that Ramisi's current mold was too tight, but we also learned that we need to change the orientation of the mold to enable more horizontal movement

### What went well?
* We succesfully emailed Ms. Hite and organized times to meet with Ramisi

### What was difficult?
* We didn't do any molding this week and were in general not extremely productive (emailing Ms. Hite was the main point of action)
* There were only 3 days of school and two days of engineering class, so there was not a lot of time to work with

### What is your plan for next week?
* Communicating with Ms. Hite about how to make our final design
* Making a comfortable mold for Ramisi
* Experimenting with the idea of a Anantawan-inspired design


# Week of November 14th:
### What did you work on?
* We followed up to Dr. Hite's response by sending her a PDF of what we have done so far and asking for her thoughts on different design options
* We did molding with Ramisi on Friday using a cup as a container for the boiling water, as opposed to a flat cookie tray.

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Making the PDF for Dr. Hite
* Setting up times to meet with Ramisi 
* Doing molding with the cup instead of the cookie tray

### What decisions were made?
* We've decided to change our current design. Having the hand orientation be veritcal as opposed to horizontal (the natural way) is uncomftorable and ineffective. We should have thought more about this when making our design
* To use a cup instead of cookie tray. The cup makes it much easier to cover all surface area of the mold
* To look into using a 3D printed / thermoplastic hybrid design

### What new resources did you find?
* The cup for pouring the boiling water into

### What new issues were discovered?
* That our current design idea is not adequate and has to be changed
* We have been using the same thermoplastic sheet for our molding, but with many consecutive attempts, the plastic becomes stuck to itself and hard to make back into a flat sheet for redesign

### What went well?
* We got the cup for molding and emailed Dr. Hite

### What was difficult?
* It's quite frustrating the pace the project is going. Obviously, our client directly benefits from us making a succesful design, so it feels like a diservice to not be doing the best we can. 
* We may try Elisabeth's design (horizontal design), Anantawan's design (the spatula), or a thermoplastic-3D-printed hybrid. We don't know which is best, and it's hard not having clarity.

### What is your plan for next week?
* Rethink, redesign, remold
* Hopefully communicate with Dr. Hite
* Develop a new design that works well


# Week of November 28th:

### What did you work on?
* We were very productive this week, which was a good contrast to the difficulty we had with having to redesign from last week. It also helped that we had thanksgiving break as a week off. 
* We worked on remodeling Ramisi's design / sketching possible ideas
* We developed a model from cheap materials of what we want the design to look like, and it was functional
* We also asked Mr. Miller to reassure Alex that we haven't forgotten about them

### The main endeavors of this week were as follows:
* Sketching out ideas
* Designing a prototype of the idea we liked and was functional

### What decisions were made?
* We scratched our previous design and went back to the drawing board
* We did brainstorming on both a Google Doc and piece of paper
* We debated reaching out to Dr. Hite in case she was simply busy, but because she has not responded, we will likely sent a second follow up over the weekend or next week
* We also updated Elisabeth on the project and our current model to see her thoughts (she hasn't responded yet, though)

### What new resources did you find?
* PLM Flex 3D printing
* Basic constructing supplies for rudimentary prototyping (tape, adhesive wrap, styrofoam (with a laser cutter), and clay
* Nuts and bolts as fastening mechanisms. Also, a 3D-printed clamp design

### What new issues were discovered?
* The tea kettle we were heating up our water with broke after Luke dropped it while taking it home after break and his dad threw it out because the top was cracked. In turn, we have to look for a new tea kettle, and because we didn't have one this week, we couldn't use thermoplastics and so used basic supplies
* Not neccessarily new, but the delay in communication between us and Dr. Hite remains a challenge

### What went well?
* A lot went well -- we used all the time we had, didn't wait around, and succesfully prototyped
* Luke was out of class Friday, but Angus still was productive and finished the working prototype
* We effectively followed a design process with finding out what we had to change, how to do it, and then doing it.

### What was difficult?
* We didn't have Dr. Hite's input on our work because she hasn't responded the past week or so
* We didn't have thermoplastics
* We didn't have a tea kettle

### What is your plan for next week?
* To create our model out of refined materials (thermoplastics, wood if neccessar, adhesive wrap / velcro, etc.)
* Work with Ramisi to experiment with the new design
* Hopefully get in touch with Dr. Hite
